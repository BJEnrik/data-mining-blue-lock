<h1 style="color:#000000">I. Executive Summary</h1>

Soccer is a two-team sport composed of eleven(11) players per team who competes to score goals by getting the ball into the opposing team's goalpost. The modern version of the sport as we know it today was popularized in England in the 19th century. It is considered to be one of the most widely played and watched sports in the world that features major international tournaments and highly skilled players.

It is the goal of every professional team to create the possible team they can out of the pool of players. This responsibility is handled by the team's scouts and managers. However, these managers cannot just pick players based on popularity or ability to score alone as it will ruin the team's chemistry. To optimize a soccer team, one must select players of varying specialties such as scoring, defending, play-making, goalkeeping, and whatnot, to ensure a perfect balance between roles and at the same time cover each other's weaknesses. Just as how individual skill is imperative, it is also equally important to give focus on team dynamics and choose players who complement each other on and off the field to work cohesively as a single unit.

This project aims to build a tool for scouts and managers that determines the natural playing position of players using dimensionality reduction and clustering. The use of clustering will uncover patterns and structures in data that may not be immediately apparent to the human eye. By doing so, we can create gain insights and be able to create the perfect team.

There are endless applications to this project which include but are not limited to the following:
1. Roster Creation
2. "My Manager" game mode in soccer-themed video games
3. Moving a player to a different position that better suits him.
4. Customized Training Program
5. Player Trades
6. Formulation of in-game tactics

<h1 style="color:#000000">II. Problem Statement</h1>

As scouts and managers for an international team, how can we cluster players based on skills and attributes to match team expectations and aid in player selection for creating the ultimate pool of players for the Upcoming Seasons of the UEFA Europa League.
